      <h1>Thoughts / Disclaimer</h1>
      <p className="text-left">For starters I would like to personally thank everyone who is taking their time today to dredge though this in concideration of hiring me, or at the least entertaining the idea of interviewing me.</p>
      <p className="text-left">Secondly. In concideration in developing this micro app. I would like to apply a disclaimer. Since the window is 2 hours, there are plenty of corners I trimmed off in development. Such as the backend having any form of login or authentication for the API's. I utilized Codeigniter for my backend as this is a framework I am comfortable in standing up in a short amount of time. Zend is something I am familiar with, and have developed against. It is just something I haven't stood up barebone in some time. This all said, I am trying to stick to the 2 hour window pass fail. And handing it in wether its complete to my standard or not (excluding the intentional corners cut) for your review.</p>
      <p className="text-left">Third I appreaciate you guys alloting me extra time while I finished up my previous contract (which ended up taking until this morning (Friday the 9th)). I know you guys are looking to move quick. And I hope to be the person you move with. As I won't let you down.</p>
